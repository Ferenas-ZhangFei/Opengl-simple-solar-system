# Opengl-simple-solar-system
This demo is to achieve a simple solar system based on C++ and OpenGL(glut), which might be an useful guidance for the beginners.

The functions in this demo are:

Animation of eight planets, including Orbital revolution and self-rotation.

The lighting of each planet.

Views change.

Texture rendering.

YOU don't have to install any package if using VS. If not, you have to download the Glut package.

If using VS, the code can be directly run by opening the .sln in VS (Debug). If not, the whole program is actually one main.cpp and some texture pictures, which might be helpful and convenient for rebuilding.
